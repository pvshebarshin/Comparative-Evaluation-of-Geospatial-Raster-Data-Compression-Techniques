### Comparative-Evaluation-of-Geospatial-Raster-Data-Compression-Techniques

In the modern world, raster data surrounds us almost everywhere. They are used in photos that we see every day on websites, in weather forecasting and a variety of studies. It is difficult to overestimate their importance and the need to develop approaches to their processing and analysis. In my work, I consider NDVI floating-point raster data that I received after calculating data from the Landsat 8 research space satellite, as well as GeoTIFF raster data with positive integer values. These data will be processed by six specialized algorithms for compression and decompression of raster data in order to compare their speed, analyze the feasibility of their use in the practical application of data transmission and compare their effectiveness by compression ratio. For a more visual comparison of the effectiveness of algorithms, tables, graphs and diagrams of various indicators for comparing algorithms will be presented in the conclusions.
